# Registration & Downline System Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the complete registration approval workflow and downline tree system implemented for the iGrow platform.

## System Workflow

### 1. User Registration
- User fills registration form with plan selection
- Data is sent to `/api/registrations` (POST)
- Registration is created with status: `pending`
- Plan amount is automatically extracted from program string
- User receives confirmation message

### 2. Admin Approval
**Admin Dashboard**: `/admin`
- Admin logs in with credentials
- Views all registrations in a table
- Can filter by name, email, or phone
- Each pending registration shows:
  - User details (name, email, phone)
  - Program selected
  - Plan amount (₹)
  - Current status badge
- Admin can:
  - **Approve**: Clicking "Approve" button sends `POST /api/registrations/{id}` with `action: 'approve'`
  - **Reject**: Clicking "Reject" button sends `POST /api/registrations/{id}` with `action: 'reject'`

When approved:
- Status changes to `approved`
- `approvedAt` timestamp is recorded
- If user has a referral code, they are linked to their parent (downline tree structure)

### 3. User Login
**Login Page**: `/login`
- User attempts to login with email and password
- System checks registration status:
  - If status is `pending`: Shows error "Your registration is pending admin approval"
  - If status is `rejected`: Shows error with rejection reason
  - If status is `approved`: Login successful, stores user data with plan info

### 4. User Dashboard
**Dashboard**: `/user/dashboard`

After login, user sees:

#### a) Status Alert
- If pending: Yellow alert showing approval pending
- If approved: Green alert confirming account is active

#### b) Plan Information (Only if approved)
- Displays selected program
- Shows plan amount (₹)
- Shows account status

#### c) Downline Tree View (Only if approved)
- Shows the user's complete network of referrals
- Displays stats:
  - Total Members: Count of all direct + indirect referrals
  - Total Revenue: Sum of all downline plan amounts
  - Network Levels: Depth of the referral tree
- Shows expandable/collapsible tree with each member:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Status badge
  - Plan amount
  - Join date

#### d) Referral Program Section
- Shows referral code (e.g., IGROW-{userId})
- Displays referral link for sharing
- Shows referral benefits
- Lists all referral tier levels

## Testing Guide

### Test Scenario 1: Successful Registration & Approval
1. Register a user at `/login` with any plan
2. Go to `/admin` with the administrator credentials configured via environment variables.
3. Find the registration and click "Approve"

1. Register User A (no referral code)
2. Register User B using User A's referral code: IGROW-{User A ID}
3. Approve both registrations
4. Login as User A
5. Check downline tree - should show User B

### Test Scenario 3: Multi-Level Network
